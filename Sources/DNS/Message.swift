/// The header section is always present.  The header includes fields that

/// standard queries.  The question section contains fields that describe a
/// question to a name server.  These fields are a query type (QTYPE), a
/// query class (QCLASS), and a query domain name (QNAME).  The last three
/// sections have the same format: a possibly empty list of concatenated
/// resource records (RRs).  The answer section contains RRs that answer the
/// question; the authority section contains RRs that point toward an
/// authoritative name server; the additional records section contains RRs
/// which relate to the query, but are not strictly answers for the
/// question.
